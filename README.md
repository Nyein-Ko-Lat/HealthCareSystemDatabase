## Health Care Appointment & Patient Visit Management System Database
### Overview
This repository contains the relational database design and implementation for the HealthCare Management System.
The database supports patient registration, doctor scheduling, appointment booking, clinical visits, and diagnosis recording.

The database is designed using MySQL, follows BCNF (Boyce–Codd Normal Form) principles, and integrates seamlessly with a Spring Boot backend (Java repository linked below).

🔗 **Backend (Java) Repository**:

### 🧱 Database Design
🔹 Core Entities

The database consists of the following key entities:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Entity</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>patients</td>
      <td>Stores patient demographic and medical profile data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>family_history</td>
      <td>Family medical background of patients</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>doctors</td>
      <td>Stores doctor information and specialization</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>doctor_schedules</td>
      <td>Weekly availability schedules for doctors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>appointments</td>
      <td>Appointment bookings between patients and doctors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>patient_visits</td>
      <td>Stores doctor information and specialization</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>patient_conditions</td>
      <td>Diagnosed conditions during patient visits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>status_codes</td>
      <td>Centralized status management (APR, FIN, DEL, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Database Setup (MySQL)
Run Database Scripts (IMPORTANT ORDER)
_**Script Location : https://github.com/Nyein-Ko-Lat/HealthCareSystem/tree/master/DatabaseFiles**_
Execute the following SQL files in order:

01_db_schema.sql : **Creates all tables + insert required Roles, Status Code, and Admin User**

Defines primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and relationships

02_triggers.sql :

Creates database triggers for data consistency and automation

03_views.sql :

Creates database views used for reporting, dashboard queries, and all listing and get data store procedures use views

04_stored_procedures.sql

Creates stored procedures used by the application and reports

⚠️ Do not change the order, as later scripts depend on earlier objects.
Dashboard & Report Data Setup

To support dashboard and reporting features, sample data is provided via SQL scripts.

### Master Data Insert

05_db_insert_data.sql : Inserts following master data

Doctors, Patients, Doctor schedules

⚠️ _**This script:**_ :

_Deletes all existing related data_

_Resets auto-increment values_

_Prevents duplicate record conflicts_

### Transaction Data Insert

06_db_insert_transactions.sql : Inserts following transaction tables

Appointments, Patient visits, Consultation / diagnosis records

⚠️ **_Depends on data created in the previous script_**

### Additional Queries

To support data management and analytics, the database includes the following additional queries that can be run independently of the Java backend:

Update Queries – For modifying existing records.

Delete Queries – As java project does logical deletion of records using the StatusCode flag instead of physical deletion. However this queries does acutal delete

Analytical Queries – Queries designed to extract insights from the database, including:

1. Patient make appointment however not visit without cancel.
2. Top patient coming to clinic by their condition
3. Top patient coming to clinic by dr's specialty
4. Dr with their appointment counts
5. Patient that make appointment and not visit
6. Most common reason that come to each doctor

These queries demonstrate the database’s capabilities for reporting, monitoring, and operational analysis, without requiring frontend integration.
